            - Oh no! Is it possible to get everyone back to normal using four or more bodies?

            - I'm not sure. I'm afraid we need to use... <strong><a

    Sophia's drones are simple robots and they do the dangerous works.
    So Sophia has the backup machine for robots.
    This machine can copy robot minds, but it has one more non documented function.
    The backup machine can work as mind switcher for robots.<br>
    Once Sophia did not off the machine and leave drones in the same room.
    When she had returned some drones already swapped their minds with each other.
    We should help and return all as it was.
</p>

<p>
    We have journal which drones (the machine write information about bodies) were switched.
    And one more problem - <strong>no pair of bodies can swap minds more than once</strong>.
    But with two additional bodies we can return any switching chaos in the normal state.
    And we have these bodies -- Nikola and Sophia will help us ("nikola" and "sophia").
</p>
<p>
    You are given an array with with information about recent swaps. Each entry is a set with two names of robots.
    You can operate with bodies which were writen in the journal and with two additional - "nikola" and "sophia".
    Find the sequence of swap to return all minds in their bodies.
    The result should be represented as a list/tuple of sets with two names in each.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A journal as a tuple of sets. Each set contains two strings.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The sequence of actions as a list/tuple of sets. Each set contains two strings.
